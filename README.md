# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
This is a simple implementation of the popular game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to play
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. 
You will see a game board with five buttons representing the game's options: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock. 
Click on one of the buttons to make your choice, and the computer will randomly choose its own option. 
The winner of the round will be determined according to the following rules:

Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Rock crushes lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes scissors
Scissors decapitate lizard
Lizard eats paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes rock
Rock crushes scissors
The game will keep track of the score, and the first player to reach five points will win the game. 
Once the game is over, an alert will show and when you click OK the game will reset.
